Dovahkiin, Dovahkiin, naal ok zin los vahriin,
Wah dein vokul mahfaeraak ahst vaal!
Ahrk fin norok paal graan fod nust hon zindro zaan,

Huzrah nu, kul do od, wah aan bok lingrah vod,
Ahrk fin tey, boziik fun, do fin gein!
Wo lost fron wah ney dov, ahrk fin reyliik do jul,
Voth aan suleyk wah ronit faal krein

Ahrk fin zul, rok drey kod, nau tol morokei frod,
Rul lot Taazokaan motaad voth kein!
Sahrot Thu'um, med aan tuz, vey zeim hokoron pah,
Ol fin Dovahkiin komeyt ok rein!

Dovahkiin, Dovahkiin, naal ok zin los vahriin,
Wah dein vokul mahfaeraak ahst vaal!
Ahrk fin norok paal graan fod nust hon zindro zaan,
Dovahkiin, fah hin kogaan mu draal!

This was a triumph
Im taking a note here
HUGE success 
Its hard to overstate my satisfaction
aperture science
We do what we must, because we can
for the good of all of us
besides the ones who are dead

but theres no crying over every mistake
you just keep on trying till you run out of cake
and the science gets done and you make a neat gun
for the people who are still alive

im not even angry
im being so sincere right now
even though you broke my heart and killed me
and tore me to pieces
and threw every piece into a fire
as they burned it hurt because
i was so happy for you

now these points of data make a beautiful line
and were out of beta were releasing on time
so im GLaD i got burned think of all the things we learned for the people who are still alive

go ahead and leave me
i think i prefer to stay inside
maybe youll find someone else to help you
maybe Black Mesa

That was a joke 
haha
fat chance

anyway this cake is great its so delicous and moist.
look at me still talking when theres science to do 
when i look out there it makes me GLaD im not you
I've experiments to run
There is research to be done
On the people who are
Still alive
And believe me I am
Still alive
I'm doing science and I'm
Still alive
I feel fantastic and I'm
Still alive
While you're dying I'll be
Still alive
And when you're dead I will be
Still alive


Still alive
